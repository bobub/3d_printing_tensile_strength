# 3d_printing_tensile_strength

This script is an initial prototype and a proof of concept for a model that predicts the tensile strength of 3d printed parts using the 3d printer input settings. This model would allow for creating 3d printed parts which have a more predictable tensile strength, so that mechanical design engineers can save time in the creation of alpha and beta prototypes for mechanical loading applications.
